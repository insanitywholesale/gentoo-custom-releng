Gentoo Release Engineering Builds
---------------------------------
This is the repo of the Gentoo Release Engineering team, used to host build specs.

To use these builds, you need Gentoo's Catalyst tool.

Official Repo GitWeb: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/releng.git/
Read-only mirror: https://github.com/gentoo/releng

This is my fork of it with configuration changes I like.
If you use it, feel free to submit a PR with improvements or fixes.
The biggest addition is ZFS but things like vim, tmux, htom and ansible are also included.
