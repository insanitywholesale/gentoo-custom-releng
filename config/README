This directory houses the config files for catalyst to be used by releng
build boxes. To use these config files, add a symlink in a build box from
/etc/catalyst/release to this dir.

Old config files that serve as examples are stores in the old subdir.

Changes to these files should be discussed with the members responsible
for individual build boxes / arches or with the RelEng team.
